### Hello👋 I'm Juan Felipe Rubio Sanabria,a Passionate Software Developer 


I am in the world of technology, immersed in lines of code 👨🏻‍🚀 when I am not programming, I am doing another activity that strengthens my learning such as English or recreational activities since these help me clear my mind and have a better capacity in the moment of program.📱
